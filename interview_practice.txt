# The STAR technique is a useful strategy for responding to interview questions that require an anecdote. It’s an excellent way to organize your thoughts. # There are four steps to answering using this technique: 

    # (S) Situation. Describe the situation in which the event took place.
    # (T) Task. Describe the task you were asked to complete. If there was a particular problem or issue you were trying to solve, describe that here.
    # (A) Action. Explain what action you took to complete the task or solve the problem.
    # (R) Results. Explain the result of your actions. For example, if your actions resulted in completing a task, resolving a conflict, improving your company’s sales record, etc., explain this. Try to focus on how your actions resulted in a success for the company.
